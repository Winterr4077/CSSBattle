Awesome job! Let's continue. You can control how opaque an element is, also called as opacity.

Change the opacity of the <div> from 1 to 0.5

This will make it 50% opaque (50% transparent), thus revealing the background behind it.

---

Now make it fully transparent by giving it an opacity of 0

That is how we can visually hide an element.

Also, you might have guessed - opacity can be a number between 0 and 1.

But opacity can be given in percentages as well - 0% to 100%.

Try it, give the <div> a 70% opacity.
