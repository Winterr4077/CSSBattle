Now that we have our <div> selected, let's play with it!

Let's change its size.

Change <div> tag's width to 50px and height to 80px

---

Width/height can be given in percentages too. It means the percentage of the element's parent.

Change <div> tag's width to 100%

---

Change <div>'s width & height both to 100px.

Well...that's how you make a square with CSS, by giving same width & height!
